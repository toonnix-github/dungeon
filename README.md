# Dungeon Explorer

A small dungeon crawling prototype built with React. Navigate rooms, avoid traps and collect treasure.

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow buttons in the on-screen controller to move Bjorn around the 7Ã—7 grid.
2. When you step into a room with a chest, click the chest to roll dice and try to open it.
3. Trap rooms require a successful dice roll to disarm. Failing will damage your hero.
4. Fight goblins that appear and gather loot to improve your gear.
5. Explore as many rooms as you can and try to survive the dungeon!
